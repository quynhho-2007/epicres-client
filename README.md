## Introduction To EpicRes: :tada:

:thinking: _Have you ever experienced reoccuring food waste after cooking, because you groceries shopped more than you need?_

:thinking: _Have you ever felt that the long process from planning meals, listing groceries and ingredients prepations is what stops you from cooking more?_

EPICRES is an app for shoppable recipes that combines groceries shop, meal plan and recipe design into one simple Click 'buy'.

Features are designed, keeping in mind: :tipping_hand_woman:

- Suggest recipes based on preferences and diet.
- Order just enough ingredients, no food waste (feature: What's in your fridge?).

I am currently working on a mobile app version with React Native :calling:.

Here you can watch [Demo](https://github.com/quynhho-2007/epicres-client/blob/master/assets/Homepage.gif?raw=true) :eyes:

Here you can check the [live version](coming soon) :technologist:
